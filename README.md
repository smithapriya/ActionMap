# Actionmap

<div style="text-align: center;">

Actionmap is an app that allows users to learn more about their representatives, political events in their area as well as aggregate, share and view news items in their locality.

Further information on how you can set up your own ActionMap using Ruby on Rails, apply linters, use Heroku and more can be found [here](https://github.com/vidhichander/ActionMap/tree/master/docs) 

The Heroku webpage created can be found [here](https://glacial-falls-32149.herokuapp.com)

I did not write the entirety of this code. Some parts were written by the staff of CS169L at University of California, Berkeley.
